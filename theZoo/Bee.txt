<b> <br/>Like all insects, a bee's body is divided into three parts: a head with two antennae, a thorax with six legs, and an abdomen. <br/>
<br/><br/> All bees have branched hairs somewhere on their bodies and two pairs of wings. <br/>
<br/><br/> Only female bees have stingers (which are modified ovipositors, organs originally used to lay eggs).</b>
